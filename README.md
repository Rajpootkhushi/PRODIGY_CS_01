# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption and Decryption

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform the encryption and decryption.

## Features

- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts previously encrypted text.
- User-friendly interface for inputting messages and shift values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher
   python caesar_cipher.py
   
2. Follow the prompts to:
Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
Input the message you want to process.
Provide a shift value (an integer between 1 and 25).

3. The program will display the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.
